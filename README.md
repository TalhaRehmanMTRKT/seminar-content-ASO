## 🚀 How to Run

### 📌 Run C++ Code

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TalhaRehmanMTRKT/seminar-content-ASO.git
   cd seminar-content-ASO/code
   ```
2. Open the Visual Studio project (`.sln` file).
3. Make sure CPLEX is correctly installed and linked in project properties. If you want to setup the CPLEX with VS follow this tutorial-> https://youtu.be/k_Z-F8nbXjU?si=pNkK4ZjboQaw3nvx
4. Build and run the project.
